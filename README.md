## ðŸš€ Key Features

- ðŸ”— **Stellar Integration**  
  Real-time token issuance, transfers, and trustline management with near-zero fees.

- ðŸŒ  **Star Drawing Consensus**  
  Blocks are mined using star-path algorithms and harmonic scores of nodes, inspired by wave synchronization and gravitational resonance.

- ðŸ“œ **Immutable Event Logging**  
  Every major Stellar operation is recorded as an `EXTERNAL` transaction in Raven Stellaratorâ€™s blockchain, creating a permanent audit trail.

- ðŸ§  **Network Stability Analysis**  
  Uses harmonic entropy and trend scoring to monitor the health and predictability of the network.

- ðŸª™ **Stars Token**  
  A custom asset issued on Stellar and permanently logged in Raven Stellarator, representing value, coordination, and trust.
